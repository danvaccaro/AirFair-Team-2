Status Report as of April 24, 2023

What was accomplished during the week:
Edited html, css. Started implementing backend in PHP and got it to parse user forms and send user information to database. Was also able to query database.

Challenges and issues team faced during the week:
Working on the backend was surprisingly difficult. It took a long time (and help from Ming) to have PHP recieve POST requests. We were also surprised by how difficult
it was to send automated emails. Ming kindly suggested Mailer to Go. I was still having issues and was able to schedule a zoom with Mailer to Go, bug turned out to be
an error on their end.

Goals for the next week:
Connecting PHP backend to webscraper in Java. Configuring cron. Making powerpoint.
