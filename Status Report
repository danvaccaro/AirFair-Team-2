Status Report as of April 3, 2023
What was accomplished during the week:
- Katherine:  My code now sucessfully lets the user choose any date within the next 330 days (previously could only choose dates in the current month).

              My code sucessfully dodges a bot-detection strategy. Previously, Expedia would input the wrong locations if they detected suspicious traffic from
              a single IP address. Now, I'm able to update the location in a way Expedia doesn't try to change.
              
              My code scrapes the cheapest flight prices and puts the flight information into a text document.

- Dan:        I began writing the javascript with a basic user defintion, as well as added jquery to the repository. The user info is now stored into a user object
              once it is submitted.

Challenges and issues team faced during the week:
- Katherine:  Webscraping is much more precarious than I would have expected. My biggest fear is that the website will be re-designed/names of html elements will
              change and my code will no longer run. Thankfully, up until now, Expedia has been very stable. The following were among my biggest challenges:
                    - Selenium failed to click on buttons from time to time. Using JavaScriptExecutor fixed this.
                    - Searching for elements by cssSelector failed from time to time. Using search by xpath and adding wait statements often fixed this.
                    - Interacting with the calender was different every day, which made certain test cases time dependent. For example, when running my program
                      during the last week of March, Expedia suggested flights in April. I had to allow for the possibility that the user wanted to book in March
                      and, thus, click back to the previous month. Now, at the beginning of April, this isn't necessary because the suggested dates are also in
                      April. Testing throughout the month has been useful in spotting edge cases like this.

- Dan: N/A

Goals for the next week:
- Katherine:  I hope to populate the text file with information from 5 round-trip flights options per search (currently only scrapes one option one way).
- Murt:
- Dan:        I plan to expand the user definitions and interface to support multiple trips per user.
