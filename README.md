Problem Statement:
Who wouldn’t like a cheap flight to Hawaii? We all have places we’d like to visit and, with the surge in remote work in today’s post-Covid digital world, checking off our travel bucket lists is more possible than ever before! But who has time to scour the web night and day for that perfect flight?  If only, there was a way to analyze, understand, and purchase tickets at humbling prices…


Solution:
…there is! AirFair allows you to input your dream destinations, along with your preferred local airport, budget, and a range of dates that work for you. We’ll email you with our best finds so you can spend all your time planning the vacation.
Using Web-Scraping, our team will search Expedia and email the user with great tickets that fit the user’s constraints.
