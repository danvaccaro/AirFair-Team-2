Status Report as of April 10, 2023

What was accomplished during the week:
- Katherine:  While I did not upload new code, I ran the program throughout the week making sure it continued to work (e.g. testing that the calender still interacted
              correctly with new dates, no bugs became apparent.)
- Murt:       working on Heroku as part of Lab 11 and Lab 12 to learn the basics
- Dan:        N/A
- Vanessa:    I began writing the stylesheet to style the html code to appear how we want it to per our mockup image. I was successful in formatting the containers, but still need to work on container placement

Challenges and issues team faced during the week:
- Katherine: N/A
- Murt:     Troubleshooting GitHub student developer pack. Also decided to get rid of some work regarding hosting our website with AWS, as Heroku looks like a better
            option.
- Dan: N/A
- Vanessa:  N/A

Goals for the next week:
- Katherine:  Save data from multiple flights into text file.
- Murt:       learning the database on Heroku
- Dan:        N/A
- Vanessa:    N/A
